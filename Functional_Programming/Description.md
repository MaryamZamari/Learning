#This is a document to describe my learning path for Functional Programming. 

Functional Programming is a new paradigm shift. It means, you need to change your perspective and try to solve the problems in a different way. Since it is mostly about changing your mindset, and the way you see things, it will take me a while to transition from structured programming to Functional Programming ( but it is an exciting journey). 

I started learning Functional Programming, by following a Udemy course, and then continued by doing exercises. 
In this folder, you can see the exercises I try every now and then.
